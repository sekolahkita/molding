<h3>PCB Prototype SMT Assembly Capabilities</h3>
<p>SMT Assembly -- Components are mounted by placing them directly onto the PCB's surface. We have the capabilities to assemble</p>
<p>SMT prototype PCBs in small production runs with manual and/or automated SMT production processes, including single- or
double-sided component insertions. Our production facilities can assemble the following SMT</p>
